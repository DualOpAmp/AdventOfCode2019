# Challenges

Here is a list of extra tips and tricks to streamline your solution.  If we have enough [repositories](repositories.md) listed, we'll call out some exceptional solutions as well.

BEAR IN MIND - there may be spoilers reading through this.

# Day 1

* Part 1 - Do you know the difference in Python between `/` and `//`?
* Part 1 - Can you solve part one in just one expression (Hint: `sum()` and comprehensions are your friend.)
* Part 2 - Can you solve the problem recursively?
* Part 2 - Can you solve it without any if statements?

# Day 2 

* Part 1 - OpCodes sound like a great Enum (maybe an IntEnum).  You should go check out IntEnum.
* Part 1 - Can you grab all three addresses of an instruction in one assignment?
* Part 2 - Did you nest your for loops for noun and verb?  Check out `product()` in the `itertools` library

# Day 3

* Part 1 - Intersections, eh?  Maybe you want to check out `set()`
* Part 1 - Did you know `min()` takes a key argument?  Can you use that?
* Part 2 - Consider tracking length with `enumerate()`

# Day 4

* Part 1 - Can you solve the problem using regular expressions and backreferences?
* Part 1 - Can you solve the problem with `groupby()` from the `itertools` library?
* Part 2 - Can you solve it with a regex?  Do you know the difference betweene `re.findall` and `re.finditer`?

# Day 5

* Part 1 - ParameterMode looks like a great use of Flag or IntFlag
* Part 2 - Can you refactor your computer out so it can be used for day 2 or day 5?


# Day 6

* Part 1 - Can you solve the problem recursively?
* Part 2 - Can you solve the problem using Dijkstra's algorithm?

# Day 7

* Part 1 - Can you use `permutations` in the `itertools` library?
* Part 2 - Can you solve the problem using `Threads` and `Queues`?

# Day 8

* Part 1 - Did you know about the `count` method on collections?
* Part 2 - Were you able to `zip` anywhere?

# Day 9

* No challenges yet

# Day 10

* Part 1 - Do you know about `defaultdict`.
* Part 2 - Do you know about `atan2`?  How about `cycle` from itertools?

# Day 11

* Do you know about `%`.  Can you write your turn and move without any if statements?


# Day 12

* This one is hard enough, do you really need another challenge?

# Day 13

* This is the second program that you need your computer to have different input and output functions.  Can you generalize your computer to pass in different functions at construction time based on what input/output should be?

# Day 14

* Can you solve it with the `Counter` class from `collections`?

# Day 15

* No challenges yet
