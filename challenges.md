Here is a list of extra tips and tricks to streamline your solution.  If we have enough [repositories](repositories.md) listed, we'll call out some exceptional solutions as well.

BEAR IN MIND - there may be spoilers reading through this.

# Day 1

* Part 1 - Do you know the difference in Python between `/` and `//`?
* Part 1 - Can you solve part one in just one expression (Hint: `sum()` and comprehensions are your friend.)
* Part 2 - Can you solve the problem recursively?
* Part 2 - Can you solve it without any if statements?

# Day 2 

* Part 1 - OpCodes sound like a great Enum (maybe an IntEnum).  You should go check out IntEnum.
* Part 1 - Can you grab all three addresses of an instruction in one assignment?
* Part 2 - Did you nest your for loops for noun and verb?  Check out `product()` in the `itertools` library

# Day 3

* Part 1 - Intersections, eh?  Maybe you want to check out `set()`
* Part 1 - Did you know `min()` takes a key argument?  Can you use that?
* Part 2 - Consider tracking length with `enumerate()`
