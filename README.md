# AdventOfCode2019
A list of additional challenges, repos and visualizations for AdventOfCode2019


Welcom to HSV.py's Advent Of Code 2019 repository.  We wanted to build things as a community, and this is our first go
at trying this out.  Feel free to write issues to let us know what you'd like to see from the HSV.py community.

Let's take a look at what this repo has to offer:

## Repositories

Do you want to take a look at other people's code to get an idea of how others solve problems?
Take a look at [Repositories](repositories.md).  Feel free to add your own repository by opening up a PR against
this repo and adding your repo to the document.  All levels of expertise are welcome to contribute a repo, even beginners.

## Challenges

Do you want to learn Python better?  In [Challenges](challenges.md), we'll post daily tips and tricks for you to learn
Python better; you'll get to learn cool syntax tips and libraries.

## Visulizations

We know there's a lot of data-viz folks out there.  Here's a chance for you to play around with different vizualizations.  Create an issue for a visualization you'd like to see, or add a new visualization (doesn't matter if there's some there already) through a PR.  This can help out our community learn visualization tools and conceptualize the problems better.  Check them out at [Visualization](viz/viz.md)
